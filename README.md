# Internship Capstone Project – Healthcare Software Engineering

## Overview

This repository documents my internship-based capstone project completed as part of the **CISC 4900 Capstone Course**. The project is based on my Software Engineering Internship at **Soaper**, a healthcare technology company focused on reducing administrative burden for physicians through automation and data-driven systems.

The capstone emphasizes real-world engineering work, including backend development, system integrations, security, testing, and collaboration within a production healthcare environment.

## Internship Context

- **Company:** Soaper  
- **Industry:** Healthcare Technology / EMR Systems  
- **Role:** Software Engineering Intern  
- **Focus Areas:** Backend APIs, integrations, security, and reliability  

My work contributes directly to live systems used by physicians and patients, rather than a simulated or academic-only project.

## Project Focus

The core focus of this capstone is building and maintaining **secure, scalable backend infrastructure** that supports physician workflows. Major areas include:

- API development using FastAPI  
- Role-based and organization-scoped access control  
- Integration with external healthcare services  
- Reliability, testing, and compliance-driven development  

A significant portion of the work involves healthcare interoperability and administrative automation rather than clinical decision-making.

## Key Technologies

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI  
- **Frontend:** React  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Caching:** Redis  
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth, OAuth  
- **Integrations:** Epic (FHIR), Surescripts, Quest Diagnostics, Availity, Stripe, Zoom  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub  

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

The initial PoC validates a secure e-prescribing workflow using **Surescripts staging**. It demonstrates the ability to send and receive prescription data, handle pharmacy responses, enforce EPCS and role-based rules, and pass staging test requirements reliably.

## Prototype and Pilot

As the internship progresses, the project expands to full-stack development across backend and frontend systems. Later stages focus on stabilizing features, supporting live users, and contributing to the product launch planned for April.

## Learning Objectives

This capstone demonstrates:

- Applying software engineering principles in a real production environment  
- Designing and maintaining secure APIs  
- Working with complex third-party integrations  
- Managing scope, reliability, and real-user impact  
- Communicating progress through documentation and reports  

## Notes

Due to the nature of healthcare software, proprietary code, credentials, and sensitive data are not included in this repository. This repository serves as documentation and reflection for academic purposes only.
